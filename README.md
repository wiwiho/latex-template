# LaTeX templates

This repository contains some of my LaTeX templates.

`template/template.tex` is the template that I curruently use for most documents including homeworks and tutorial materials.

`slides/slides.tex` is the template that I currently use for 師大附中資訊培訓 and some other lectures.

I will keep the above two templates up-to-date ~~if I don't feel lazy to do that~~.
As you see, there are other stuff in this repository.
Most of them were used for contests I held in the past.
I rarely have a chance to use most of them.

- `apcsm`: For APCS Mock Contest (held by 師大附中電算社 in 2020). It imitates the style of real [APCS](https://apcs.csie.ntnu.edu.tw/).
- `good-statement`: For 師大附中資訊培訓 (including 師大附中資訊學科能力競賽) and 師大附中/延平中學 競技程式讀書會.
- `problem`: For 2020 師大附中電算社社內賽.
- `test-paper`: For 師大附中資訊學科能力競賽筆試.
- `thspc`: For 2020 師大附中資科科校隊培訓. It imitates the old style of THSPC (臺北市資訊學科能力競賽), which differs from the style of THSPC these years.
- `schedule`: For the course shedule of 110 師大附中/延平中學 競技程式讀書會.

For the problem statement templates, 
I am planning to remake them in a new project, 
which includes not only statement templates but also some scripts for generating good-looking problem statements easily.
They will be removed here after the new project is released (the day may not exist if I am too busy).
